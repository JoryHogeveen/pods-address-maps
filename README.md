# pods-address-maps
This repo contains two addon plugins for dev purposes: Pods Address field &amp; Pods Maps component.

The code is the same as on the official [PR at Pods GitHub](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/pull/3634), only refactored as plugins.
I will make sure the code keeps maintained as long as this feature isnâ€™t within Pods core.

## Installation
Upload both folders in this repo to the WordPress plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
Another option is to create separate .zip files from both folders and upload them through the regular WordPress plugin installer.

## You need an Google-Maps-API Key! 
first get yours here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/
then paste it in the plugin settings: /wp-admin/admin.php?page=pods-component-maps
